This project was created during the Technigo boot camp.

This project was to build a piece of the classic game Cluedo.
To build it in Javascript and be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. There should also be a button to reveal the mystery.
It should be responsive and mobile first.
